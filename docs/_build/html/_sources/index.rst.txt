`pompy` - puff-based odour plume model in Python
================================================

`pompy` is a NumPy based implementation of the puff-based odour plume model described in

    Farrell, J.A., Murlis, J., Long, X., Li, W. and Card√©, R.T., 2002.
    Filament-based atmospheric dispersion model to achieve short time-scale
    structure of odor plumes. *Environmental fluid mechanics*, 2(1-2), pp.143-169.

What is `pompy` for?
--------------------

`pompy` allows simulation of dynamic 2D odour concentration fields which show some
of the key characteristics of real chemical plumes in turbulent flows including short
term intermittency, diffusive effects and longer term variations in spatial extent and
location, while being cheaper to run than a full fluid dynamics simulation.

An example simulated concentration field generated by the package is shown below
