PomPy allows simulation of dynamic 2D odour concentration fields which show some
of the key characteristics of real chemical plumes in turbulent flows including short
term intermittency, diffusive effects and longer term variations in spatial extent and
location, while being cheaper to run than a full fluid dynamics simulation.
